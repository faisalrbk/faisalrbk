### Faisal Hameed  

I'm a full-stack web dev (mern stack  & Next.js) who somehow ended up studying GIS & Remote Sensing. and sometimes dabbling in the Python AI/ML world.

 lol, by now you probably know  what exactly I’m doing.

**Fun Facts:** 
- i use Arch Linux btw.
- I’ve learned almost everything from YouTube.
- From **FreeCodeCamp** to Indian YouTubers, I’ve been through almost every web dev tutorial that exists on YouTube.
- I like watching anime and web series, listening music, playing chess, and rubab.
